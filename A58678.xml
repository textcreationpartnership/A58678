            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the juſt Complaint of the Brewers, that the Gagers of the Commiſſioners and Farmers of Exciſe, do not obſerve the Aſſize of Beer and Ale according as they are commanded to do by the Ordinance of the Lords and Commons in Parliament, made <hi>September</hi> the 11. 1643. <hi>Article</hi> XXIII.</p>
            <p>Becauſe they do not Gage the Brewers by the right Standard-Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, as appeareth by theſe Statutes following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Ordinance, for Meaſures made in <hi>Incertis temporibus,</hi> and Printed amongſt the Statutes made the XVIII. <hi>Anno Edw</hi> 2. by the conſent of the whole Realm of <hi>England</hi> the Meaſures of our Sovereign Lord the King are made, <hi>viz</hi> An Engliſh Penny, called a Sterling, round and without clipping, ſhall weigh 32 Wheat-corns, in the midſt of the Ear, and XX<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſhall make an Ounce, and 12 Ounces one pound, and 81 ſhall make a Gallon of Wine, and 8 Gallons of Wine ſhall make a buſhel <hi>London,</hi> which is the eighth part of a Quarter.</p>
            <p>Note that by the Old Law theſe are the weights and Meaſures of the Realm.</p>
            <p>By the Act made 12 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. theſe Weights and Meaſures in the Ordinance aboveſaid are enacted to be Standards in <hi>haec verba; Wherefore the King our Sovereign Lord, by the aſſent of the Lords ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and temporall, and the Commons in Parliament aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame Ordaineth, Eſtabliſheth, and Enacteth, That the Meaſure of the Buſhel ſhall contain</hi> 8 <hi>Gallons of Wheat, and that every Gallon ſhall contein</hi> 8 <hi>pound of Wheat of Troy-weight, and every pound ſhall contein</hi> 12 <hi>Ounces of Troy-weight, and every Ounce ſhall contein</hi> 20 <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,

               <note place="margin">Which Old Law is the Ordinance above. The Standard of England.</note> 
               <hi>And that it pleaſed the King's Highneſs to make a Standard of a Buſhell, and a Gallon after the ſaid Aſſize, to remain in his Highneſs Treaſury for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it appears plainly that the Wine-Gallon is the Standard-Gallon.</p>

            <p>Secondly, for that it agreeth exactly with the 8 l of Wheat of Troy-weight, as will appear by an eaſie experiment; a pound of Wheat of Troy-weight filling exactly the Wine pinte.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for that it is the leaſt of Gallons, and therefore the very Exemplar by which all Meaſures are to be made, both of dry things as Corn, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Gallon by which Mr. <hi>Lyon</hi> gageth the Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Tuns is not the Wine-Gallon, <note place="margin">M Lyon is the Gager generall to the Farmers.</note> therefore not the Standard mentioned in the Act, therefore not the Standard of England, for it holds as he himſelfe affirms, 272 Cubicall-Inches, which is bigger then the <hi>Standard-Gallon</hi> by 41 Cubicall-Inches and leſſe then the Ale-Gallon by one eighteenth part.

            <p>In his Preface he ſaith in the Office at <hi>Broad-ſtreet</hi> in the year 1656. he found two different Gallons, The one made and placed there, and of uſe in that Office from the beginning of the Exciſe, having the <hi>Guild Hall</hi> mark and ſtamp on it; The other placed in that Office, with the name of <hi>John Reynolds</hi> thereon.</p>
            <p>That theſe two different Gallons were placed in that Office, is not to be denied: But that that Gallon with the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> mark or ſtamp on it, was in uſe to Gauge the Brewers Tunne from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Office, or that the Brewers paid Exciſe by that Gallon is a notorious untruth: For that M. <hi>Winſtanley</hi> who was the Gauger gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of that Office, and introduced that Gallon made by the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> Standard, which is the ſame with the Exchequer Gallon, for which M. <hi>Lyon</hi> contends.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35711:7"/>the Brewers contend for. The which Gallon agreeth with the Coopers Scantling for the Beer barrell. This agreeth likewiſe with the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester</hi> or Ale quart Eight Gallons of this makes the common buſhel, which is the <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Buſhell uſed in this Land. As is made plainly to appear, by that Treatiſe called the <hi>Cry of the Oppreſſed,</hi> &amp;c. So that the Exchequer Gallon was never made uſe of by M. <hi>Winſtanley</hi> in that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to Gauge the Brewers Tunns, or ever practiſed by any Artiſt for Gauging of Ale or Beer, untill M. <hi>Lyon</hi> came into that Office in 1656. All which M. <hi>John Hayes</hi> (an Artiſt nominated in his paper (can teſtifie.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Lyon</hi> proceeds in the commendation of himſelfe, and to the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his moſt wicked innovated oppreſſion, And ſaith. Theſe two different Gallons put him upon a further ſearch into the Legali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Gallons, then any of his praedeceſſors did.</p>
            <p>He ſaith, in his ſearch he found by the Statute of 23. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. That the Barrells were to contein 36. Standard Gallons, &amp;c. And further ſaith that he found by the Statute of the 12. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. That there was a Standard Gallon to remain in his Highneſſe's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, and therefore he, by the appointment of the Commiſſioners of <hi>Broad-ſtreet,</hi> did go to the Exchequer, and by that Standard Gallon did exactly make this Gallon, by which he Gaugeth the Brewers Tunns, and ſo concludes that therefore his Gallon, is the Standard Gallon mentioned in the Act 23. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. and by which the Brewers Barrels muſt be made, and conſequently, by which their Tuns muſt be Gauged. This is the ſtrength of his Argument, in which your Honours may obſerve an apparant Fallacie, as well as in his Preface a notorious Falſity, his Argument is but this.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The Gallon in the Exchequer is the Kings Standard Gallon.</l>

                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Coopers Barrells muſt be made by the Exchequer Gallon.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This is a Sillogiſme in the ſecond figure, and all Affirmatives, and therefore a Paralogiſme, as is a nother like it.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:35711:7"/>
            <p>Firſt, by the Letter of the Act of the 12. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choquer Gallon is not the Standard Gallon; for that Act doth ſay expreſly, That 8 pound of Wheat Troy weight, ſhall make that Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon according to the Old Law, which Old Law ſaith, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> That 8. pound of Wheat of Troy weight ſhal make a Gallon of Wine, As by a ready experiment will eaſily be made appear, A pound of of Wheat of Troy weight, filling exactly the Wine pint; Whereas this Exchequer Gall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Letter of the Law, the Exchequer Gallon is not the Standard Gallon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the equity of that Act, this Gallon M. <hi>Lion</hi> contends for was made a Standard Gallon for drie things, as Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore according to that Aſſize it is made with its due proportion to the Wine Gallon, which all Artiſts obſerve to be the proportion of 28. to 33. The reaſon why it was there placed, was for preventing of miſtake in ſizing of Gallons and Buſhells, which were to be ſent down into Market Towns, nominated in a Schedule to that Act annexed, for if they ſhould have gone to have made their Gallons and Buſhells by the Wine meaſure, they would have been very apt to have miſtaken in the true ſizing of them according to the proportion of drie things to the Standard Gallon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, By the equity of that Act, The Standard for Beer and Ale was likewiſe made, and is now at Coopers Hall, and it is called the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid or Water meaſure, which is provided for; by that Act of the 12. <hi>Hen</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. and the 11. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4 which is, by the expreſs words of that Act, the proportion of 5. to 4. ſo that Statute of 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. Provides that the water meaſure, ſhall hold 5. pecks of the Standard raſed and ſtricken. And this Standard Gallon for Beer and Ale is mentioned in the Statute 31 <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 8. and there called the Standard Gallon, appointed and allowed for Beer and Ale; All this will plainly appear to your Honours, if you dilligently read and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Statutes made the 11. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. and 12. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. with 31. <hi>Elizab. Cap.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. That the Statute 12. <hi>Hen Cap.</hi> 7. doth ſay that all Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons that do not agree with it ſhall be broken, aſwell thoſe that were in the Treaſury, as in all places or Towns whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An.</hi> This muſt neceſſarily be underſtood of the meaſures fordry things,

               </gap> wine Gallon, the very foundation of meaſures, and that which is principally in uſe, muſt be broken. And they that uſe it by that Act of the 12 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. are to be fined, &amp; ſeverely puniſhed, as by the act appears; ſo that it's evident, it's to be underſtood of dry things only which are to be meaſured in Markets and other places.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. Saith that every barrell for Beer, ſhall contain 36 Gallons of the Kings <hi>Standard Gallon</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, &amp;c. but there is no other <hi>Standard Gallon</hi> in the Exchequer, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Statute of 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. doth not mention the Kings <hi>Standard Gallon</hi> of the Exchequer, but onely the Kings <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard Gallon,</hi> which properly is to be underſtood of the Wine-Gallon, as aforeſaid, and as that ſtatute doth import. For that Statute doth ſay, that every Barrell for Soape ſhall contein 32 Gallons &amp;c. Which the Coopers, who are made the Judges of the Content of all Veſſels made by vertue of that Act. And to whom, by that act, the ſizing and gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of all Veſſells, are committed, and for that end have ſworn Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Sealers appointed. Do explain it in their Ordinance, that every Barrell for Sope ſhall contain 32 Gallons of the Kings <hi>Standard Gallon</hi> for Wine; and accordingly do make the Sope-veſſels by that Gallon, But if it be granted, that by the <hi>Standard Gallon</hi> mentioned in the Act 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. Be meant the Exchequer-Gallon, for which Mr. <hi>Lyon</hi> doth ſo much contend, and for which if the Brewers were ſo ſelfiſh, as Mr. <hi>Lyon</hi> inſinuates the Brewers are. Then they might likewiſe contend thereby they might ſave in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 100000 l<hi>per annum,</hi> for which over meaſure they have not one penny. But by that very Act, the Coopers are commanded to make their Barrells by the Coopers great Gallon, which agreeth with Mr. <hi>Reynold's</hi> Gallon now in Broad-ſtreet; and that by a <hi>Proviſo</hi> at the End of that Act, whereby it is enacted that every Cooper, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall make any veſſells ſpecified in the ſaid Act; ſhall from the feaſt of <hi>Pentecost</hi> next coming, make every ſuch veſſel according to the Aſſize, ſpecified in the Treatiſe, called <hi>Compoſitio Menſurarum (viz.)</hi> Every barrell for Ale to contain 32 Gallons of the ſaid Aſſize or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; of which eight Gallons make the Common-buſhell to be uſed in this Realm. Every Kilderkin 16 Gallons; which Common-buſhell holds eight Gallons, according to Mr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his Gallon in <hi>Broad-street,</hi> and the Coopers great Gallon, conteining 288 Cubicall Inches ¾ as is plainly made appear in the Treatiſe called, <hi>The Cry of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:35711:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But Mr <hi>Lyon</hi> doth urge his Argument further and ſaith that theſe meaſures of the Exchequer were confirmed by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but names no ſtatute: And by King <hi>Charles,</hi> at the beginning of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament which confirmes the ſaid Meaſures of the Exchequer, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains that any Law uſage or Cuſtome to the Contrary</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, Wherein he doth very much Impoſe upon your Honours, and doth us a great injury by concealing the truth, for that very ſtatute doth provide, that notwithſtanding any thing in that Act, the Liquid meaſure ſhall remain the ſame throughout the Nation which agreeth with our great Gallon as is aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Thus We have cleared up (as we humbly conceive) the fallacy of Mr. <hi>Lyon's</hi> Argument. The ſecond thing that he undertakes is to prove that we are not enforced to pay our exciſe by another, a thing ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roius and ſo often proved by all the Artiſts of <hi>London,</hi> and by the Maſter and Wardens of the Company of <hi>Coopers.</hi> That we might very well ſave our labour in diſproving of it, which is but <hi>actum agere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But leſt M. <hi>Lyon</hi> ſhould glory in his folly, fallacies, and falſities as we do underſtand hee doth. This impudent falſity wee thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas he ſaith that he tryed ſeveral barrels in ſeveral mens houſes in his paper nominated, &amp; he found ſeveral new barrels ſealed, which he tryed by his Gallon, wch hold but 36 Gallons &amp; a half, &amp; ſome leſs, what Barrells thoſe were, he by his rod picked out we cannot tell, for the maintenance of his ſowicked an Oppreſſion. But ſure wee are as he very well knows, that the moſt of the Barrells in thoſe mens houſes did contein 38 Exchequer-Gallons, and ſo ought to do by the Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers Scantlings; otherwiſe they are not to be ſealed by the Sealers Oath, but to be broaken, and the Sealer that ſealed them, and that Brewer that ſells by them, are puniſhable by the Statute, 23 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he ſaith the Brewers in St. <hi>Giles,</hi> &amp; <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> have cut their Gallons &amp; made them equal to the Gallon in the Clark of the market hands in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which implies their Gallons were bigger before then the Exchequer Gallon. And what they have done for to preſerve themſelves from being ruined by his unjuſt Gage: we cannot tell, but in ſo doing, we ſay they have wronged the poor, and by thoſe ſmall meaſures do grind the faces of the poor, if they have done that which Mr. <hi>Lyon</hi> affirmes to be done by them. But Mr <hi>Lyon</hi> muſt know that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35711:9"/>the Clarks of Markets, that ſeal Gallo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for Ale or Beer, as they ſeldom do, &amp; as we humbly conceive, doth not belong to them: They ought to ſize them by the Ale, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Quart, four quarts of which makes the Ale-Gallon as is made appear in the Treatiſe called, <hi>The Cry of the Oppreſſed.</hi> The Ale-Gallon, &amp; he, <hi>Wincheſter</hi> half-peck being all one. Thirdly, Whereas he doth confeſs that it is true which <hi>Samuel Starling</hi> ſaith, that the Ale Gallon muſt be made by four <hi>Wincheſter</hi> or Ale quarts. But ſaith that four <hi>Wincheſter</hi> or Ale quarts agrees exactly with the Exchequer Gallon; We aver the contrary and ſay, that four <hi>Winchester</hi> quarts doth over run the Exchequer Gallon one 18 part. So that we being come to this ſhort iſſue, we do hope that this controverſie will by a quick and eaſie experiment, be made appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Honours, and put a period to this oppreſſion, and clear up the matter for the future, and the difference of that meaſure, properly called the <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> or Liquid, or Ale meaſure, from that meaſure called the Exchequer, be fully underſtood.</p>
            <p>M <hi>Lyon</hi> concludes his Remonſtrance with letters of commendation of himſelfe, and his <hi>quondam</hi> Maſters, and our more then Turkiſh or barbarous Patrons, ſaying. All which being conſidered by Impartiall ones, ſurely they wil cenſure the Brewers of ſelfiſhneſs at the leaſt, and undoubtedly they will approve of the Commiſſioners of Exciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in walking and Acting by, and according to the ſaid Standard; And it is hoped by the ſaid <hi>John Lion</hi> that they wil be ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him, as that they will commend him for diſcharging his ſaid Truſt with faithfulneſs therein, who made (as he ought) the ſaid Standard Gallon his Rule to walk by in the ſaid Imployment. But we do hope and pray that (contrary to M. <hi>Lions</hi> Expectation) as your Honours have been inſtrumentall in removing theſe hard task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters; So likewiſe that you will not ſo far commend and approve of <hi>John Lion,</hi> the Introductor and Aſſertor of ſo great an oppreſſion; contrary to the practiſe of all Artiſts; The Statutes of the Land; the Cuſtome and uſage of the Maſter and Wardens of the Company of <hi>Coopers,</hi> who by Law are made the Judges of the content of the Barrel; And that you will not onely give <hi>John Lion</hi> a <hi>Quietus eſt</hi> from his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Gauger generall to the Commiſſioners in <hi>Broad-ſtreet;</hi> who firſt of all, he by his falſe pretences, informations, and ſuggeſtions, did induce to take up this moſt unequall Gauge.
